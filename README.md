# Australian-wild-fire-data-analysis-and-visualization
**Project Title**: Wildfire Dataset Analysis and Visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Folium, plotly and Dash

Description: This project aims to analyze and visualize the wildfire activities in Australia using the provided dataset. It will explore patterns and trends, and create visualizations to gain insights into the behavior of wildfires in different regions of Australia.

Tasks:

**Part 1**: Analyzing the wildfire activities in Australia

- Task 1.1: Plot a line chart to show the change in average estimated fire area over time.
- Task 1.2: Plot the estimated fire area over month.
- Task 1.3: Develop a bar plot to show the distribution of mean estimated fire brightness across the regions.
- Task 1.4: Develop a pie chart to show the portion of count of pixels for presumed vegetation fires across regions.
- Task 1.5: Customize the pie plot from Task 1.4 for a better visual representation.
- Task 1.6: Develop a histogram of the mean estimated fire brightness.
- Task 1.7: Develop a scatter plot to show the distribution of estimated fire brightness across regions, with region as the hue.
- Task 1.8: Develop a scatter plot to show the correlation between mean estimated fire radiative power and mean confidence level.
- Task 1.9: Mark all seven regions affected by wildfires on the Map of Australia using Folium.

**Part 2**: Dashboard to display charts based on selected Region and Year

- Task 2.1: Add a title to the dashboard.
- Task 2.2: Add radio items and a dropdown to the dashboard.
- Task 2.3: Add two empty divisions for output inside the dashboard.
- Task 2.4: Add the output and input components inside the app.callback decorator.
- Task 2.5: Add the callback function.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.6+
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Folium
- Dash
- Plotly

**Conclusion:**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the wildfire activities in Australia. The insights(contained in the notebook) gained from this project can be used to better understand the behavior of wildfires and to develop strategies for wildfire prevention and mitigation.
